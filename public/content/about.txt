Using the public Folder
Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.5.0 and higher.

Changing the HTML
The public folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to set the page title. The <script> tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.

Adding Assets Outside of the Module System
You can also add other assets to the public folder.

Note that we normally encourage you to import assets in JavaScript files instead. For example, see the sections on adding a stylesheet and adding images and fonts. This mechanism provides a number of benefits:

Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.
Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.
Result filenames include content hashes so you donâ€™t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.
However there is an escape hatch that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

If you put a file into the public folder, it will not be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the public folder, you need to use a special variable called PUBLIC_URL.
